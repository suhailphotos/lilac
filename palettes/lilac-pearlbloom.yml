  # --- kept from Catppuccin Latte for saturated, light-theme-friendly accents ---
  rosewater:  "#b93919"  # closest warm rose; already strong on light bg
  flamingo:   "#b73427"  # deeper salmon; complements Xcode red
  maroon:     "#9a4121"  # Latte (kept) — rich red-violet; distinct from primary red
  peach:      "#9a4412"  # Latte (kept) — vivid orange; pairs with Xcode “yellow”
  teal:       "#0f5f63"  # Latte (kept) — dark teal; bridges Xcode green↔cyan gap
  sapphire:   "#0c6a7a"  # Latte (kept) — saturated blue-cyan; sits near Xcode blues
